# Obsidian Zettelkasten Vault

This repository contains my personal Obsidian vault, structured using the Zettelkasten method to effectively organize notes for college, work, and personal projects. The vault is designed to capture, organize, and link information across different areas, allowing for easy retrieval and knowledge building.

## Overview

This vault serves as a central knowledge hub using the Zettelkasten method. The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking technique that encourages the creation of atomic (single-idea) notes and linking them for easy navigation. This vault is designed to:
- Manage college notes, work projects, and personal tasks.
- Support a mix of permanent notes, fleeting notes, and project documentation.
- Facilitate cross-referencing between notes for deeper understanding and knowledge expansion.

## Folder Structure

The vault is organized as follows:

### 00 Zettelkasten
- **000 Index**: A centralized index linking to all key notes and folders.
- **001 Subjects**: Contains folders for different subjects or areas of study. Each subject has its dedicated folder for easy organization.
- **002 Projects**: A place for ongoing projects, categorized further into work, research, and side projects.
- **003 Co-Op**: Notes and documentation specific to internships or cooperative education experiences.

### 01 Guidebook
- **010 README**: This file, providing an overview of the vault and guidelines for usage.

### 02 Templates
- **020 Basic Template**: A general-purpose template for new notes.

### 04 Permanent Notes
Contains long-term notes that represent individual ideas, concepts, or insights. These are linked across the vault for cross-referencing and knowledge building.

### 05 Fleeting Notes
Temporary notes for quick thoughts, reminders, or ideas. These are regularly reviewed and either archived or converted into permanent notes.

### 06 Resources
A repository for external resources such as articles, books, and web links. Organized by resource type or topic.

### 07 Archive
Holds completed projects, old notes, or resources no longer in active use but retained for future reference.

### 99 Meta

## Guidelines

1. **Creating Notes**:
   - Use the templates in the `02 Templates` folder for new notes.
   - Keep notes atomic: each note should contain a single idea or concept.
   - Regularly link notes to related topics to build a network of interconnected ideas.

2. **Organizing Notes**:
   - Move fleeting notes to their appropriate folders (Permanent, Project, etc.) after review.
   - Archive completed or inactive notes in the `07 Archive` folder.

3. **Reviewing Notes**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of the `05 Fleeting Notes` folder and move relevant notes to their permanent locations.
   - Update the `000 Index` regularly to reflect important or frequently accessed notes.
